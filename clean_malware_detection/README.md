# Clean Malware Detection Implementation
## Based on malware-classification-CNN-main Reference

This is a clean implementation based purely on the GitHub reference code.

## Structure
- Uses the exact approach from the reference implementation
- No color-based classification
- Pure CNN-based malware family detection

## Next Steps
1. Copy the reference notebooks
2. Adapt them for your dataset
3. Train the model
4. Test predictions
